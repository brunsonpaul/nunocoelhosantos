    <h2>Index 7</h2>
    <h6>Identity</h6>
    <p>
      Identity for a photography exhibition hosted at ProteinÂ® Gallery. There was
      no running theme across the exhibition and the identity should not mirror
      or represent any of the type of art exhibited. The result was then a simple
      logo, with the focus on the small space and number of artists showcasing.

  <div class="clear txt">
    <p>
      The logo was designed with future iterations in mind, for when the exhibition
      got larger and the index number longer. The sides of the polygon would
      also increase the number of its sides to reflect this trend.
