This was my first fashion related project, which is now a big subject of my work. Ana Barreira is a talented fashion photographer graduated from the London College of Fashion with an impessive portfolio. I approached her to help promote her work.

It was not a requirement, and certainly not a straight-forward task, to come up with an idenity for Ana. She would describe herself as belonging to the fashion world, but at the same time against it. The concept explores this characteristic and uses the capital “V” from <i>Vougue</i> magazine inverted to create a capital “A”. This followed a whole custom typeface to create the identity.

The website was developed by Tiago Alves. With the design I wanted the website to be stunning right from the first page, and simple to navigate around. The lines of the website follow the angle of the capital “A” 

This website was built using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
