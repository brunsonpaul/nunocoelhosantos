This was my first fashion related project, which is now a big subject of my work. Ana Barreira is a talented fashion photographer graduated from the London College of Fashion with an impessive portfolio. I approached Ana to help her promote her work.

It was not a requirement, an certainly not a straight-forward task, to come up with an idenity for Ana.

The website was developed by Tiago Alves. With the design I wanted the website to be stunning right from the first page, and simple to navigate around. The lines of the website follow the angle of the capital “A” 

This website was built using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
