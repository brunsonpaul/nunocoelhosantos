Design and development of my sister's digital portfolio. With this project I wanted to recreate her livelyhood adding colour to her work, display each project's thinking process as well as final outcome in a clean and simple responsive website. The portfolio is part of siteinspire.com's selected sites. Built using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Typekit, Sublime Text 2, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, PHP and Git.
