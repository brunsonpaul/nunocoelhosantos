Stylize/d
Branding & Web Design

————————————

Identity and Web Design done collaboratively with Marta Dos Santos.
Stylize/d is a fashion blog eager to show the final fashion editorials and the
proccess in making them. The identity had to radically stay from mainstream
fashion blogs with pink/yellow tones and cursive typefaces. The logo was
designed to stand out with it's geometric, clean, and monochrome approach.

The logotype was designed in a variation of outline and fill, both intended to
be used on top of an image or as a masking shape. The typefaces chosen were
<a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2" target="blank">Neturaface 2
Display</a> and <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1703"
target="_blank">Adobe Garamond Pro</a>.

This forward connects the word stylize to the word stylized as a parallel to the
approach of documenting the process of fashion rather than just its outcome.
This was established with the briefing and we deciced to use the curious
forward slash as an element of the brand, the symbol. This symbol was also
designed to combined with photography and resulted in suitable avatar for
social networks.
