		<h2>Auto-Biography Nuno Coelho Santos</h2>
		<p>I am a developer and graphic designer based in London. Born in Porto, Portugal, I moved to the UK to study at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design. During my time at CSM I founded Savant and Iterar.</p>
		<p>Before my move to London I studied at ESSR, a vocational arts school, from 2004 to 2008. I thought several times of leaving art school to study engeneering, but the creative and engaging atmosphere of this specific school kept me still. There I have learnt HTML, Adobe Flash and ActionScript 2.0 in parallel to my print-focused Graphic Design specialisation. During those years and alongside with my good friend Tiago Alves we developed mobile phone games and websites in Flash.</p>

		<p>In 2008 I moved to London and worked part-time on coffee shops and later on as a freelance web designer to help with living expenses. My years at Central Saint Martins (below) inflicted the deepest change in philosophy and way of thinking as a graphic designer.</p>
		<p>From the 14th of July 2012 my work will be exhibited at the Central Saint Martins Degree Shows.</p>
