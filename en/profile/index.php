		<h2>Auto-Biography Nuno Coelho Santos</h2>


		<p>I am a developer and graphic designer based in London. Born in Porto, Portugal, I moved to the UK to study at Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design. During my time at CSM I founded Savant and Iterar.</p>
		<p>Before my move to London I studied at ESSR, a vocational arts school, from 2004 to 2008. I thought several times of leaving art school to study engeneering, but the creative and engaging atmosphere of this specific school kept me still. There I have learnt HTML, Adobe Flash and ActionScript 2.0 in parallel to my print-focused Graphic Design specialisation. During those years and alongside with my good friend Tiago Alves we developed mobile phone games and websites in Flash.</p>
		<p>In 2008 I moved to London and worked part-time on coffee shops and later on as a freelance web designer to help with living expenses. This work outside of university pushed me to the edge of failing the course. However, my years at Central Saint Martins inflicted the deepest change in philosophy and way of thinking as a graphic designer.</p>
		<p>From the 14th of July 2012 my work will be exhibited at the Central Saint Martins Degree Shows.</p>
