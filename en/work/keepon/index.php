    <p>
      This is a app built to allow users of Kickoff for Mac to stay updated on their
      projects on their iPhones. Kickoff is an app me and a group of friends use
      to collaborate on projects and Keepon was born out of our own need for a
      custom iOS client.
    </p>
    <p>
      This iPhone application is a client for the Mac application
      <a href="http://v1.kickoffapp.com/" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>. Kickoff
      is a project manager tool with shared notes, chat, tasks and files. Keepon,
      this mobile client, seeks to make all information available on-the-go
      and allows the user to stay updated with the progress of their work,
      assign new tasks and view files from the project folder. We wanted to
      keep the transition between the desktop and the mobile app simple and
      intuitive, sharing a similar structure and hierarchy but using the native
      components and established navigation systems.
